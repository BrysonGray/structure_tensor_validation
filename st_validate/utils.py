def interp(x, I, phii, interp2d=False, **kwargs):
    '''
    Interpolate an image with specified regular voxel locations at specified sample points.
    
    Interpolate the image I, with regular grid positions stored in x (1d arrays),
    at the positions stored in phii (3D or 4D arrays with first channel storing component)
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    x : list of numpy arrays
        x[i] is a numpy array storing the pixel locations of imaging data along the i-th axis.
        Note that this MUST be regularly spaced, only the first and last values are queried.
    I : array
        Numpy array or torch tensor storing 2D or 3D imaging data.  In the 3D case, I is a 4D array with 
        channels along the first axis and spatial dimensions along the last 3. For 2D, I is a 3D array with
        spatial dimensions along the last 2.
    phii : array
        Numpy array or torch tensor storing positions of the sample points. phii is a 3D or 4D array
        with components along the first axis (e.g. x0,x1,x1) and spatial dimensions 
        along the last axes.
    interp2d : bool, optional
        If True, interpolates a 2D image, otherwise 3D. Default is False (expects a 3D image).
    kwargs : dict
        keword arguments to be passed to the grid sample function. For example
        to specify interpolation type like nearest.  See pytorch grid_sample documentation.
    
    Returns
    -------
    out : torch tensor
        Array storing an image with channels stored along the first axis. 
        This is the input image resampled at the points stored in phii.
