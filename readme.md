# Structure Tensor Validation: Functions for validating the accuracy of structure tensor analysis for estimating orientations in 2D and 3D images.

## Features

-    Generate 2D and 3D phantoms simulating axons in brain microscopy with parallel and crossing patterns.
-    Perform structure tensor analysis to obtain orientations in 2D and 3D images.
-    Visualize image orientations and their distributions.
-    Estimate k-means of image orientations.
-    Test the accuracy of estimated orientations.
